title: "Python Stock Market Analysis Dashboard"
---

## Project overview

This project is a **Python-based stock market analysis and visualization dashboard** designed to explore price trends, moving averages, and market behavior across different time periods.

The dashboard focuses on providing **interactive insights** into stock performance, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns commonly used in technical analysis.

## Key features

- Stock selection (e.g. AAPL, NVDA, TSLA)
- Adjustable time periods (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y)
- Simple Moving Average (SMA) overlay
- Identification of upward and downward price runs
- Interactive visual exploration of historical data

## Technical analysis: Close price vs SMA

![](images/sma_analysis.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}

This visualization compares the stock’s **closing price** against its **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**.  
The SMA helps smooth short-term price fluctuations and provides a clearer view of overall trend direction.

## Tools and technologies used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Plotly / Matplotlib
- Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
- Financial data APIs (e.g. Yahoo Finance)

## Outcome

This project strengthened my understanding of:

- Time-series financial data
- Technical indicators such as moving averages
- Building interactive analytical dashboards
- Applying Python to real-world FinTech use cases
