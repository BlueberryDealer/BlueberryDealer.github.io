## The visualization
This visualization shows the relationship between car weight and fue

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency vs Car Weight",
    x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles per gallon (mpg)"
  )
```

## What was visualized
- **wt (weight)** – numerical variable representing car weight
- **mpg (fuel efficiency)** – numerical variable representing fuel efficiency

## Story behind the visualization
I chose a scatter plot because it is effective for showing the relationship between two numerical variables.  
Each point represents a car, allowing comparisons across different weights.  
The smooth trend line helps highlight the overall relationship between car weight and fuel efficiency, making the pattern easier to interpret.
