## The visualization

This page presents two quantitative visualizations created as part of my **Python stock market analysis project**.  
Both visualizations are based on **numerical stock price data** and are designed to highlight different aspects of market behavior.

## Daily returns analysis

This visualization shows the **daily percentage returns** of a selected stock over time.  
Large positive and negative spikes indicate periods of **high volatility**, while smaller fluctuations represent more stable trading days.

## Upward and downward price runs

![](images/up_down.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}

This visualization highlights **consecutive upward and downward price movements** in the stock price.  
It summarizes the number of upward and downward runs, as well as the **longest continuous trends**, providing insight into market momentum.

## What was visualized

- **Daily returns** – numerical values representing day-to-day percentage price changes
- **Stock closing prices** – numerical time-series data
- **Run lengths** – counts of consecutive upward or downward price movements
- **Volatility patterns** derived from return fluctuations

All visualizations are based on **quantitative financial data**.

## Story behind the visualization

I selected these visualizations to analyze **both volatility and trend behavior** in stock prices.  
The daily returns plot makes it easier to identify periods of market instability that are not immediately visible from price charts alone.  
The upward and downward run visualization complements this by showing how price movements cluster into trends, which is useful for understanding momentum and potential trading signals.

Together, these visualizations provide a more complete picture of stock market behavior than a single chart alone.
